<h4>Project background</h4>\n        <p>In urban development, the voices of teens are often set aside. Many young people in society feel like they don't have any say in the way their city looks and feel, and that even if they did speak up, it wouldn't matter. In this project, we were challenged to create pitch material in the form of a graphic identity and pitch film, as well as further develop a product concept already created and supported by user research done by our classmates to solve this issue. We chose to work on Re:Map. </p>\n        <p>Re:Map's concept was the placement of interactive screens in different parts of Sweden, focusing on places with lacking incorporation of youths in their urban planning. These screens would allow teens to make suggestions, wish for different kinds of development in their area (a pizzeria, soccer field, park etc) and vote on each other's ideas.</p>\n        <h3>Our mission</h3>\n        <p>Re:Map lacked a distinct graphic identity and voice, hadn't developed a hi-fi concept for what the physical screens and UI would look and feel like, or how to engage with the target user group to promote usage of the product. To connect with teens and get them involved, these things needed to be adressed, and were the main problems we decided to tackle.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_1}\n      caption=\"The concept I'd created for Re:Map prior to the group project.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>A modern punk workshop</h3>\n        <h4>My moodboard</h4>\n        <p>In the days prior to the group project, we were each given one day to complete a moodboard for a concept of our choice. I chose Re:Map. I wanted to encourage physically creating with your hands, which turned into the concept of youth workshops where you could play around with and explore different materials to create and visualize ideas for the future of the city. To attract teens to the concept and make it stand out, I worked hard to incorporate Norman’s three levels of design into the visual language, to meet the emotional needs of participants. This was expressed by bold typography, colors and shapes inspired by industrialism, brutalist genres and Kulturhuset's Lava.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_15}\n      caption=\"The moodboard I, Desirée Strand and Sebastian Åhman created for Re:Map, iterating on my original concept.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Group moodboard</h4>\n        <p>For the group project, we had to choose one project to develop pitch material for. We decided to work on Re:Map, and further develop the concept I'd created in my moodboard. We were very inspired by deconstructivism and classic punk and their historical roots. The youth workshop concept was further developed into a modern punk workshop, where you could spend time with other likeminded teens after school and create in a limitless, creative and rebellious space.</p>\n        <h3>Design methodology</h3>\n        <h4>Design thinking</h4>\n        <p>We started out with the design thinking process to build empathy with our user group. This was based on the user research conducted by the original product design group. We explored different ideas and concepts, as well as exploring user insights based on the user data through post-it clusters in Mural.</p>\n        <h4>Co-creating remotely</h4>\n        <p>Due to the pandemic, this project was done completely remotely. Therefore, we had to communicate well, deliver what we promised and work efficiently through collaborative tools such as Mural, Zoom and Google Drive. An important aspect of our project is that we all worked together on every deliverable: We were each given responsibility for designing and producing individual pieces, but we all came together as a group to iterate, propose new directions and hand off designs to finish different bits and pieces.</p>\n      </div>\n\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_personas}\n      caption=\"Erin and Lo, personas representing our primary target audiance.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h4>Personas</h4>\n      <p>To connect with our target audience and their needs, we created two young personas to represent our primary target audience, and two older personas to represent our secondary. These were based on the user research provided to us by the original concept group. The primary audience were teens of varying genders, backgrounds, technical prowess and goals, who felt it was hard to make a difference and that no one would listen if they tried; quotes taken directly from the user research. </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_personas2}\n      caption=\"Mikael and Adriana, personas representing our secondary target audience.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <p>The secondary audience were adults who were in daily contact with teens, such as parents and high school teachers. What defined them as a group was wanting to help teens make a difference and be a part of their lives, but not knowing how to go about it.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_slogan}\n      caption=\"The Re:Map tagline.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Tagline</h4>\n        <p>The tagline was designed collaboratively in the group, and features the words Reset, Redo, and Create. This was meant to be a metaphor for the conceptual timeline Re:Map was offering – first, reset the playing field and allow teens to make their voices heard by taking action. Second, redo through collaboration, changing the city according to their wants, wishes and point of view. Finally, create and let creativity and ideas flow limitlessly to change the world together – that was Re:Map's ethos.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_2}\n      caption=\"The final typography, logotypes, color scheme and icon variations.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Creating the visual concept</h3>\n        <h4>Typography</h4>\n        <p>The main typography was lifted from my original concept. I chose the humanist sans serif Syne for headlines because of its bold and modern look, echoing geometric industrial fonts such as Eurostyle. For the body, I chose Work Sans as a softer yet complimentary sans serif to balance out Syne’s bold presence. The goal was for the typography to elicit an industrial feel while still showing warmth; to take up space while still remaining open. To further add to this, as well as the punk feel, we added Märkpenna, a custom typeface created by our team mate Sebastian Åhman, as a display typeface to emphasise the DIY and rebellious feel of the concept as a whole.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage\n      image={remap_logo_sketches}\n      caption=\"Early digital sketches I made to explore ideas for the logo; the ones to the left remained virtually unchanged throughout the project.\" />\n\n      <FullImage\n      image={remap_logo}\n      caption=\"The final logo I created with the tagline added in.\" />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Logotype and icon</h3>\n        <h4>Logotype</h4>\n        <p>For the logo, we decided to rework the one from my original concept to fit our new direction more, which I was given responsibility for. I wanted the logo stand out and communicate the visual concept clearly in different situations. For this reason I explored using textures, bright colors we'd worked on and different font weights. The different font weights clarifies the humanist characteristics in Syne, adding to a warm and welcoming look. The two coloured lines represent our primary color scheme as well as the interactive screens, and how ideas put into one end affects the other. The dotted texture can be found throughout the Re:Map visual concept, and adds visual interest. The finalised version also features the addition of our tagline: \"Re:set, re:do, create\".</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage\n      image={remap_icon}\n      caption=\"The final versions of the Re:Map icon.\" />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Icon</h4>\n        <p>Re:Map’s icon is a map pin, signifying the functionality of the product as well as acting as a skeumorphistic UI metaphor on the interactive screens and website. The icon was worked on by me and Sebastian. The pin is also featured throughout the visual language, such as on posters and in the pitch film.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_monster}\n      caption=\"The final color scheme and patterns.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Industrial textures, colourful shapes</h4>\n        <p>The look and feel of Re:Map was very important for us. We wanted to include representations of industrial urban textures like metal plating, plywood panels and overgrowth into the design, while keeping a bold, symbolic and colorful aesthetic. To achieve this, we created a bright color palette, and symbolic patterns and shapes that would repeat throughout the profile. Our team mate Desirée Strand created the hashed texture seen throughout the visual language, and I created the dotted one. The color scheme was designed by me, Sebastian and Desirée.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_screens_before}\n      caption=\"The iterative process of creating the screens (to the far left is the original UI for Re:Map). 3D models and renders by Sebastian Åhman, UI by me.\"\n      />\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_4}\n      caption=\"3D mockup of the final screen concept. UI design by me, 3D model and render by Sebastian Åhman.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Interactive screen design</h3>\n        <h4>Physical design</h4>\n        <p>We wanted the interactive screens to call attention to themselves and make a statement in the environment they were placed in: The goal was for teens to get excited and want to interact with them. We played around with different materials, shapes and textures to manifest this in a physical way. We decided on two formats: One futuristic cylindrical screen to allow several users to use the screen at once, and one conventional flat, rectangular screen for single use. </p>\n        <p>The metal plating that inspired some of Re:Map’s patterns was re-introduced as a physical texture for the stand, and paired with neon lights to subvert the industrial look and communicate a forward thinking vibe. We also decided to broaden the concept to include an website with the same functionality as the screens, for teens who prefer to create at home, or who aren’t able to use the screens due to different circumstances.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_3}\n      caption=\"A mockup of the flat screen (3D by Sebastian Åhman) and the interactive web experience. UI design and website mockup by me.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>UX and UI</h4>\n        <p>I was given the task of creating the UI for the screens and website. The UI was maximalist in its idle state, but minimalist in the interactive one – this way, we could preserve the feel of Re:Map without compromising ease of use or infringe on the user experience. I worked to adhere to Norman’s six design principles, focusing on affordance, signifiers and constraints to create an enjoyable and effective user experience. If the screens were fun and easy to use without having to read instructions prior, more teens would use them and be heard as a result. </p>\n        <p>For the interactive UI, I based my design on the user research performed by our classmates. This lead to the incorporation of category based symbols for different kinds of suggestions/ideas and a progress bar.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_paper_storyboard}\n      caption=\"A late stage storyboard drawn by me, and a GIF of the paper animation I made seen throughout the film.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Pitch film</h3>\n        <p>In addition to the graphic profile, we were instructed to produce pitch material for a presentation to potential investors. This included a short film showcasing the concept. We wanted to really show what Re:Map was about. Since we had to work remotely, we chose to work with graphics, music and animation to get our message across rather than real-life video footage.</p>\n        <h4>Film concept</h4>\n        <p>The deconstructivist, cut out images of teens creating a city together paired with the bright color theme, animation and Viagra Boy’s <em>Ain’t Nice</em> were creative choices we hoped would elicit a feeling of wanting to take back the city from the adults, and make their voices heard whether “the suits wanted to listen or not”. The punk spirit really came through in the making of this film, and it really showcases what Re:Map is all about. <a href={'https://vimeo.com/500366747'}>Watch it here.</a></p>\n        <h4>Production</h4>\n        <p>I was heavily involved in the pitch film, working on- and drawing concepts, storyboards, transitions, and editing. My main responsibility was motion design and stop motion animation. The graphics were made by Desirée Strand in Adobe Illustrator, and then animated by me in After Effects.  I also shot and created the animated paper sequence seen throughout the video, and wrote most of the copy. Together we produced the Re:Do, Re:Set and Create segments in this way. The final cut was edited by me, Simon Karlsson and Sebastian Åhman.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_5}\n      caption=\"Mockups of a bus stop poster (by Desirée Strand) and Instagram post (by Ottilia Olsson).\"\n      />\n      \n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Engagement</h3>\n        <h4>Meeting teens in their space</h4>\n        <p>To further engage with teens, we wanted to create a digital- and physical media campaign in spaces where they would naturally spend time. Instagram and bus stops were two such places. To exemplify this, we created mockups of a campaign meant to call teens to action and get involved with Re:Map. Our intent was to further emphasise making them feel part of something bigger, that they would and should be listened to and that they could change their community.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={remap_results}\n      caption=\"\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3> The result</h3>\n        <h4>Pitch presentation</h4>\n        <p>Our project was an immense success. During the presentation, our project was deemed one of the best the program has ever seen, and was given very high praise by both our teachers and classmates. Re:Map was described by one teacher as being able to bring a hopeful rebellious spirit into a dull, “overdog” world. The visual hierarchy, scope and voice of the project were met with high praise from both our teachers and guest lecturer visual- and UX designer Andreas Carlsson.</p>\n        <p>In the end, we felt that we definitely met the goals we’d set out to achieve at the start of the project, and we’re very happy with having achieved it in such a short amount of time, as well as working 100% remotely.</p>\n        <h4>Future development</h4>\n        <p>Since user testing wasn’t a part of the project, we didn’t receive any user feedback or opinions from actual teenagers beyond the user research we inherited. Thus, it would be amazing to be able to test the reception of Re:Map through focus groups, and iterate further on the design to fit their wants, wishes and needs.</p>\n        \n        <h3>What I learned</h3>\n        <p>As the project was based on my original concept, I had to let go of what I’d created and allow it to grow through our collaborative creative process. Through doing this, Re:Map turned into something greater than I could have ever expected, and I’m very proud to have worked on it as part of the creative team and grateful to have been able to do so. I also got to explore new creative practices and dimensions, such as the punk aesthetic, motion design and editing a fully animated film. I learned to trust my gut more, as well as myself to make really cool design choices and develop great product concepts.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <BackToTop />\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n\n  )\n}\n \nexport default RemapContent;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/rav.aea23196.gif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sketches.7a9a5885.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/music_and_art.e1daa9fe.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/first_fox.8e7046ae.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/ui_ux.f4995e32.gif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/kp-sketch.0b00d007.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/moodboard-kp.83b10f9e.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/bjorn.c5b4341a.gif\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport FullImage from \"./CaseCmpnts.js\";\nimport rav from './assets/swedishanimals/rav.gif';\nimport sketches from './assets/swedishanimals/sketches.png';\nimport music_and_art from './assets/swedishanimals/music_and_art.png';\nimport first_fox from './assets/swedishanimals/first_fox.png';\nimport ui_ux from './assets/swedishanimals/ui_ux.gif';\nimport ui_ux_sketch from './assets/swedishanimals/kp-sketch.png';\nimport kp_moodboard from './assets/swedishanimals/moodboard-kp.png';\nimport bjorn from './assets/swedishanimals/bjorn.gif';\nimport BackToTop from \"./BackToTop.js\";\n\n\n \nfunction SwAnimalsContent(props) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"InnerCaseWrapper\">\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={rav}\n      caption=\"\"\n      />\n      \n      <div className=\"visit-case-subject\">\n        <a href={'http://mi.sh.se/~19anhj/DIK/Slutprojekt%20Kreativ%20Programmering%202/'}>Experience Codimals here!</a>\n        <p>* This experience is not responsive, and works best on 13\" screens.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Introduction</h3>\n        <p>Codimals was conceived during the course Creative Programming (7,5hp). We worked in pairs to perform different assignments over a one month period, where we were given two weeks to complete our final project. I worked with my friend Simon Karlsson on this project. We decided early on that we wanted to create an interactive experience with dynamic sound, graphics and text, to challenge ourselves into learning new skills in JavaScript.</p>\n        <h3>Project goals</h3>\n        <p>In this project, we were free to create whatever we wanted on the condition that it had to be on the theme of sustainability and the environment, and implement the visually creative JavaScript library p5.js. We had to deliver the interactive experience within two weeks, as well as a workbook detailing our creative process and motivations.</p>\n      \n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={kp_moodboard}\n      caption=\"Our moodboard for Codimals, drawing inspiration from minimalism, geometry, textured illustrations and primary colors.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Design methodology and ideation</h3>\n        <h4>Design thinking</h4>\n        <p>We decided to work with design thinking to build connection and empathy with the users. As this was during the middle of lockdown, we were unable to connect with children for research and testing, however as we’d both worked a lot with children, we were able to channel our experiences into the project and act as user representatives until real user testing could be performed to iterate on our designs.</p>\n        <h4>Footstorming, sketching and brainstorms</h4>\n        <p>We began the project by footstorming. We explored shops in a nearby mall, especially the toy- and bookstore. Exploring in this way helped us open our creative space, and gain access to new impressions and ideas. We purchased a notebook to mark down ideas, sketches and thoughts. Throughout the ideation stage, we conducted brainstorm sessions where we mixed verbal discussions with rough sketches, drawings and improvised music to get a feel for the project’s ideal direction. This resulted in several lo-fi sketches as well as a moodboard.</p>\n        <h4>Ideation iteration</h4>\n        <p>We were inspired by sticker albums in the toy store to create something with storybook animals. One early idea was kit bashing an interactive experience through visualising an anthropomorphised plush toy we’d found in a toy store on screen and allow the user to interact with it. However, we had a hard time figuring out how to showcase this remotely to our class and still make the experience translate, and decided to forego it for other ideas.</p>\n        <h4>Final direction</h4>\n        <p>We decided to create an evocative experience to teach kids about the Swedish ecosystem through different nordic animals. Due to the time limitations, we limited the scope of the project to three animals. Our vision was for Codimals to be displayed on an interactive screen at a museum such as The Swedish Museum of Natural History. We were inspired by children’s books, geometry and primary colours.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={sketches}\n      caption=\"Lofi sketches and code ideas (left), as well as our first placeholder prototype (right).\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Designing an experience</h3>\n        <h4>Vision and constraints</h4>\n        <p>I had an idea where the user would be able to switch between different animals in a loop in order to learn more about them. To test this, we drew lo-fi wireframe sketches and created digital lo-fi prototypes straight in p5.js to see if our plan was viable within the scope of our programming knowledge and the library’s capabilities. We discovered we had to add some functionality in order for the UX to work out as intended, and added jQuery and the gaming library p5.play to our program.</p> \n        <p>Originally, the animals were very geometric, but once produced digitally we found them too cold for our intended experience. We drew upon the stickers from the toy store and illustrations from children's books for a more humanist feel.</p>\n        <h4>Agile work methodology</h4>\n        <p>To deliver our experience, we decided to work in a way inspired by Agile methodology and Scrum-like sprints, where we broke down our project into individual pieces to be completed within a set timeframe. This way, we could modularise the project and fit the pieces together without having to work on the entire concept all at once.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={first_fox}\n      caption=\"An early development version of Codimals, trying out the sizes of the animals.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Problem prevention</h4>\n        <p>We produced the illustrations, animations and music before producing much of the program’s code because we knew these assets would take a long time, and that the potential of code issues appearing at inconvenient times could prove arduous for us. We wanted to make sure we’d have enough time to focus on those without sacrificing the quality of our visuals and music, which were integral to the experience.</p>\n        <h4>Problem handling</h4>\n        <p>We ran into a few problems while coding; most notably, we spent two days trying to solve and issue of passing values from local and global variables through different documents. When we eventually solved it, the rest of the project was done in a flash. Although it was frustrating having  to search for solutions and not move forward for so long, it paid off to have created the assets beforehand, as we could spend more time on fixing issues in our code as a result. However, the lost time made it impossible for us to finish up the arrows we'd intended for the user to click to switch between animals. As a solution, the user can click A or D to initiate this instead.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={music_and_art}\n      caption=\"Simon and me working on the music and illustrations\"\n      />\n\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Music and illustration</h3>\n        <p>We were very inspired by TV programs from our childhood. We wanted to invoke a feeling of nostalgia, and designed music to fit this, composed and performed by Simon in Logic X Pro. For the same reason, the illustrations of the animals were further iterated upon to almost look like picture book cut-outs. These were illustrated by me in Procreate for the iPad, and edited in Adobe Photoshop. The actual animations are done live frame-by-frame through the p5.play library, which both reduces file sizes and allows dynamic control of the animation speed.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={ui_ux_sketch}\n      caption=\"A digital prototype made in Photoshop to explore ideas for the user interface\"\n      />\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={ui_ux}\n      caption=\"The finished project, showcasing the fully interactable UI\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>UX and UI</h3>\n        <h4>UI metaphors and UX ease</h4>\n        <p>We ideated on the UI together, drawing inspiration from our moodboard. The idea was to mimic bookmarks folding out onto a page of a picture book, utilising bright colors and paper textures. The monotype font was chosen to offset the softness of the illustrations, and create a pleasing contrast, as well as being legible on top of the paper textures.</p>\n        <p>When entering the site, the user is instructed to press A and D to switch between different animals, however in a display context the user would be able to press arrows on the left and right instead, or swipe. The Info button presents different information for each animal with a hint of magic realism added to spur children’s fantasies. The monotype font was chosen to offset the softness of the illustrations, and create a pleasing contrast, as well as being legible on top of the paper textures. </p>\n        <h4>Browser limitations</h4>\n        <p>It would have been nice to have the background music playing right when the user enters the site – however, the reason this wasn’t done is because of browser limitations. Most browsers automatically block sound from autoplaying on websites.</p>\n        </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={bjorn}\n      caption=\"\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Result</h3>\n        <p>The finished project received praise from both teachers and classmates alike, focusing on the music and animated illustrations showcased in the project. We’d successfully created a project on the theme of sustainability of ecosystems, combining p5.js with p5.play and jQuery to channel the concept and experience we wanted.</p>\n        <h4>The future of Codimals</h4>\n        <p>We would love to perform actual user tests with children to ensure Codimals achieves what we set out to do. As we’d taken the direction of making children care for animals by introducing them in this interactive space, our hope is that it would make children more aware of nature and ecosystems. Given more time, we would’ve loved to add more animals and incitement on how to care for the animals by making changes in the users’ day to day lives. Due to time constraints, we didn’t have time to make the experience responsive, and focused on perfecting it for 13” screens. However, it works well on some screens below and above. </p>\n        <h3>What I learned</h3>\n        <p>Through working on Codimals, I learnt that even small scale projects can take a lot of time when you’re working with new code libraries. It also taught me to draw on previous experience and represent a target audience empathetically when direct user research isn’t an option. Working with Simon was great for me, as I at the time tended to lean more practical and forgo the artistic parts of creative projects. He helped me understand that you can combine both practicality and efficiency with artistic choices to create meaningful user experiences.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <BackToTop />\n\n    </div>\n\n  )\n}\n \nexport default SwAnimalsContent;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_moodboard.d499ad14.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_personas.4f5e5419.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_behovsanalys.b076d0f7.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_kravspec.90ee4e03.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_lilalinjen.9e96197a.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_framsida.72a219a3.gif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_lofi.3fd14e2b.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_coloriteration.2c028305.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_hifi_wireframes1.f24656ec.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_kodplan.457cadb4.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_overview.0a8285e5.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_final1.6ccda1ca.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_howmightwe.6c49292e.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_insights.675eaa44.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_idegen.8f772521.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_trigger.e9273332.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/internetskolan_finalhifi.ae2ad336.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/illustrationer.e123a8c6.jpg\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport FullImage from \"./CaseCmpnts.js\";\nimport internetskolan_moodboard from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_moodboard.png';\nimport internetskolan_personas from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_personas.png';\nimport internetskolan_behovsanalys from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_behovsanalys.png';\nimport internetskolan_kravspec from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_kravspec.png';\nimport internetskolan_lilalinjen from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_lilalinjen.png';\nimport internetskolan_framsida from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_framsida.gif';\nimport internetskolan_lofi from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_lofi.png';\nimport internetskolan_coloriteration from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_coloriteration.png';\nimport internetskolan_hifi_wireframes1 from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_hifi_wireframes1.png';\nimport internetskolan_kodplan from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_kodplan.png';\nimport internetskolan_overview from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_overview.png';\nimport internetskolan_final1 from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_final1.png';\nimport internetskolan_howmightwe from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_howmightwe.png';\nimport internetskolan_insights from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_insights.png';\nimport internetskolan_idegen from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_idegen.png';\nimport internetskolan_trigger from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_trigger.png';\nimport internetskolan_finalhifi from './assets/internetskolan/internetskolan_finalhifi.png';\nimport internetskolan_illustrationer from './assets/internetskolan/illustrationer.jpg';\n\nimport BackToTop from \"./BackToTop.js\";\n \nfunction InternetskolanContent(props) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"InnerCaseWrapper\">\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_framsida}\n      caption=\"Front page of the launched hi-fi prototype.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"visit-case-subject\">\n        <a href={'https://amhjo.github.io/internetskolan/'}>Experience Internetskolan here</a>\n        <p>* This prototype is not responsive, and works best on 13\" screens.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Introduction</h3>\n        <p>In the spring of 2021, we were tasked to take on real, live design projects with a client as part of the class “Designproject” (7,5hp). We had a month to work with our client and produce a design solution to fit their needs. We got paired with Spånga-Tensta Municipality to help them find solutions to the digital divide in the community.</p>\n        <h4>Project background</h4>\n        <p>The digital divide refers to different groups in society being shut out from different services and opportunities due to low digital literacy. In Spånga-Tensta municipality, the digital divide especially affects seniors and people with disabilities. Spånga is a middle-class, fairly affluent and predominantly white community, while Tensta is of lower socioeconomic status, much more culturally and ethnically diverse, and is listed on the Swedish Police’s list of especially vulnerable areas. As such, there also exists a sociocultural divide between the communities.</p>\n        <h3>Problem statement</h3>\n        <p>Spånga-Tensta municipality administration tasked us with finding solutions for the digital divide in the municipality, especially regarding the elderly and those with neuropsychiatric disabilities. As such, our problem statement became: <em>“How can we solve the issue of the digital divide in Spånga-Tensta?”</em></p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_overview}\n      caption=\"An overview of our Mural wall, where we did most of our Empathy, Define and Ideate work.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Design Thinking</h3>\n        <p>We decided to work with design thinking in order to build a thorough, user centered focus for our solution, as well as iterate our concept throughout the project. We used Mural to collaborate, gather our thoughts and insights, as well as analyze and map our findings as we went.</p>\n        <h3>Empathy</h3>\n        <h4>Contextual user research</h4>\n        <p>Prior to the project, we  individually conducted heavy user research into Spånga-Tensta as a single municipality and individual communities. This way we created an understanding for the complexities of the communities, how users might differ or be similar, as well as finding interesting perspectives to work with during the project. We also analyzed external data on the digital divide from The Public Heath Agency of Sweden, The Swedish Internet Foundation and SeniorNet.</p>\n       </div> \n\n       <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_insights}\n      caption=\"Mapped and categorized insights from research articles as well as our user surveys.\"\n      />\n\n       <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>User surveys and data mapping</h4>\n        <p>As this was during the height of the pandemic and our users were vulnerable to infection as well as possessing low digital literacy, it was hard for us to meet our users “in the wild”. We decided to conduct user surveys to get in touch with our users. I was very involved in both shaping, spreading and analyzing the surveys.</p> \n        <p>We shared the surveys in different Facebook groups for people living in Spånga and Tensta, and asked that they help our users partake in the survey by functioning as spokespersons. As the response count was lower than we’d have liked, we also got in touch with elderly people affected by the digital divide outside of Spånga-Tensta to receive insight on the issue on a wider scale. Afterwards, we mapped our findings and iteratively added insights produced as a result. I suggested color coding our findings for an easier overview.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_behovsanalys}\n      caption=\"The insight maps we created from our user research, the blue post-its representing data from our surveys and orange representing data from external research.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Mapping insights and user needs</h4>\n        <p>Once we'd gathered enough data, we summarized and analyzed our findings by mapping our users' needs. From the survey turnout, we realized we wouldn't be able to get in touch with enough neurodivergent people to support our user centered methodology. We decided it'd be better to shift our focus to seniors, who'd proven to be much better represented in our research. However, we realized both groups had some needs in common, such as minimizing mind strain, creating intuitive navigation and short, concise paragraphs, and so our solution would be able help some of these users as well. This felt important to me, as they were also affected by the digital divide.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_personas}\n      caption=\"\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Personas</h4>\n        <p>Based on the data from the surveys, we created three personas. Agda, Nahom, and Anna. Agda and Nahom were part of our primary user group; seniors living in Spånga and Tensta. Anna represented our secondary user group; younger users with neurodivergency. Their common denominator was experiencing difficulties due to the digital divide. The personas were made to represent different demographics and people in Spånga-Tensta, which was very important to us, as well as our client, in designing our solutions.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_howmightwe}\n      caption=\"An excerpt from our brainstorm on Point of View and How Might We-statements.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Define</h3>\n        <h4>Point of View and How Might We</h4>\n        <p>To get closer to understanding our users’ needs, we produced a myriad of How Might We-prompts as well as a collective Point of View.</p>\n        <div className=\"bigwords\">Elderly people over 65 need to learn more about the internet in order to dare to be involved.</div>\n        <div className=\"bigwords-caption\">– Our Point of View</div>\n        <div className=\"bigwords\">How might we teach seniors about the internet in a fun and inspirational way?</div>\n        <div className=\"bigwords-caption\">– Our final How Might We-prompt</div>\n        <h4>Core values</h4>\n        <p>As the project was evolving, the amount of information we’d collected about our users, Spånga-Tensta and different strategies began to pile up. To prevent getting off track, I suggested we condense our user insights into a few core values to lead our project throughout our iterative process. These were:</p>\n        <div className=\"bigwords\">Knowledge, Meaningfulness, Participation, Safety, Independence.</div>\n        <div className=\"bigwords-caption\">– Our core values</div>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_kravspec}\n      caption=\"The requirement specification we created in Mural.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Requirement specification</h4>\n        <p>Following our user research and analysis, I suggested we create a requirement specification to follow and iterate on throughout the project. This was used to recognize and identify different constraints and goals the project had to adhere to and meet, and communicate those to the entirety of the group. I initiated working with the three stages of functional, cognitive and emotional needs, as well as functional and non-functional requirements.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_idegen}\n      caption=\"An excerpt from our brainstorm and cluster session.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>Ideation</h3>\n        <h4>Brainstorming with post-it clusters</h4>\n        <p>Drawing from all the data we’d collected, we began brainstorming different ideas. Afterwards, we clustered similar concepts together and color coded them to get a better overview. Interesting concepts and ideas that stayed throughout the entire project included a service through the municipality libraries allowing seniors to rent digital devices, as well as personnel helping out with, for example, applying for- and installing digital ID, setting up devices and downloading apps. </p>\n       </div> \n\n       <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_moodboard}\n      caption=\"An early moodboard for what Internetskolan could look and feel like.\"\n      />\n\n       <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>The birth of Internetskolan</h4>\n        <p>Inspired by the online course Elements of AI I’d taken during the summer, I suggested a website that would function as a sort of “start” to the internet – a free, open online course with lessons on different subjects related to the internet, how it works and how to utilize it (from basic to advanced) that the users could go through at their own pace. The thought was to help our users get a a better grasp on the internet by helping them create more informed mental models. Discussing the idea within the group, we added that the website could also contain helpful features such as a link bank of useful and safe links, and a lexicon to learn more about internet slang and expressions. It would also be important to be able to choose between languages predominant in Spånga-Tensta, such as arabic and tigrinya. Both the project group, client and teachers loved the idea, and we decided to pursue it further.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_trigger}\n      caption=\"The four styles used in the online surveys (left), and the typographic- and color treatments we asked users to rate in real life (right).\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h4>Trigger material</h4>\n        <p>We continued to iterate our concept through quick feedback cycles with our users. To settle on a visual style, we created trigger material to present to users. These were performed both through online surveys and real life sit downs, allowing users to rate what they liked and disliked, as well as tell us why. This stage also presented us with new, important information, such as users preferring shorter paragraphs with many illustrations due to it easing their mental strain. Our users really liked the bright, minimalistic styles with simple, rounded illustrations, layouts with plenty of white space as well as the color purple.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_lilalinjen}\n      caption=\"Concept illustrations of Lila Linjen made by me.\"\n      />\n\n    <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h4>Lila linjen – \"The purple line\"</h4>\n      <p>As part of our brainstorming sessions, we discussed how to help seniors contextualize the platform. Inspired by a train line map our project leader Linda Norlén had drawn to illustrate the users’ location on the site as well as lesson structure, I came up with the idea of Lila Linjen (The Purple Line).</p> \n      <p>Lila Linjen would act as a metaphor for the whole concept, having different stations (lessons) that would teach the user new things, while using trains as a metaphor both in copy, illustrations and for teaching. We also thought Lila Linjen would be a great way to bring Spånga and Tensta together as a community. Our client adored the idea, and so did we.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_lofi}\n      caption=\"Our lo-fi wireframes created in Figma.\"\n      />\n\n    <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h3>Prototyping</h3>\n      <p>As we were working completely remotely, I suggested to work together through Figma, actively referring to our user research, maps and insights produced in Mural. During this time, I was heavily involved in designing both the UX and UI, focusing on intuitiveness and accessibility according to the needs we’d recognized in our user research.</p>\n      <h4>Lo-Fi prototyping</h4>\n      <p>The goal of the lo-fi prototype was to convey the concept idea to our user group and client in order to get further feedback on the concept, page types and layout.</p> \n      <p>As we couldn't test on our users directly due to the pandemic, we had to find user representatives of a similar demographic within our close circle. We tested the prototype by presenting the wireframes to these representatives on tablets and laptops, describing the goal, idea, and what a lesson could look like. Both users and client liked the idea very much, and gave us some more valuable tips to implement in later iterations, such as the value of making the website feel safe and adding descriptive captions to images and interactables.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_hifi_wireframes1}\n      caption=\"Our first iteration of hi-fi wireframes in Figma, where Lila Linjen was still the main concept.\"\n      />\n    \n    <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h4>Hi-fi prototype phase 1</h4>\n      <p>The hi-fi wireframes were designed with the intention of making the website fun, easy and encouraging to use. The colors, layout, typography and illustration style were all based on user feedback from the trigger material.</p>\n      <p>Once more we sat down with the representatives and asked them to interact with the wireframes and tell us what they thought. They liked the overall look and feel a lot, and found the website easy and fun to use as well as helpful for their needs. However, some felt that Lila Linjen as a metaphor might be confusing, and actually make it harder to use the website. We decided to rework the concept, and instead use Lila Linjen as an all-encompassing concept for dealing with the digital divide within Spånga-Tensta wherein the website played a part.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_coloriteration}\n      caption=\"Color and UI iterations throughout the project.\"\n      />\n    <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_finalhifi}\n      caption=\"Our second phase hi-fi wireframes.\"\n      />\n\n    <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h4>Hi-fi prototype phase 2</h4>\n      <p>As the structure and layout of the website had received such a great response from the representatives, we were able to spend a lot of our remaining time working on the UI, which I spent a lot of time on. Among other things, I designed the header, wanting to keep things simple yet intuitive and easy to find. I was also heavily involved in designing the layout for the front page, lessons and link bank.</p>\n      <p>We tried an array of different color combinations to make the website feel safe, educational and fun, resulting in us settling on blue for a while. However, this was later changed due to the blue not feeling fun or engaging enough, and users (as well as us) preferring the energetic purple look. I spent a lot of time working on the color treatment and typography.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_kodplan}\n      caption=\"An excerpt from our code planning sessions in Figma.\"\n      />\n\n    <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h3>Developing the web based MVP</h3>\n      <p>To finish up the project and showcase our solution to the client and their stakeholders, we developed a web based MVP prototype. At this point, the group split into our respective roles. I worked as head web developer, Desirée Strand as head media producer, Lava Persaw as head UX-designer and Linda Norlén as project manager.</p>\n      <p>We continued to work collaboratively according to our specialities, and worked live over Zoom during the entire workday to give and receive feedback and direction from the team as a whole. For example, I continued to do a lot of work on the UI, Linda on graphic design, and Lava on documentation. Desirée, Linda and I developed the majority of the website together.</p>\n      <h4>Planning and execution</h4>\n      <p>To make the collaborative coding seamless, I suggested we plan out how each part of the website would be built in Figma. This way, we could find and solve problems before they appeared, and make sure the code was uniform throughout despite never having coded together prior. It became a sort of visual pseudo-code. We decided to create the website using HTML, vanilla CSS and jQuery as all of us knew how to work with these well. We coded collaboratively using Visual Studio Code Live Share and LiveServer hosted by my (poor) laptop, GitHub and Zoom. From start to finish, the MVP took about two weeks to produce.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_illustrationer}\n      caption=\"The beautiful illustrations created by Desirée Strand and Linda Norlén.\"\n      />\n\n    <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h4>Adding the Illustrations</h4>\n      <p>We wanted to use illustrations throughout Internetskolan to help users absorb information easier, and radiate a fun, welcoming vibe. From our trigger material and user testing, we knew users preferred a rounded, simplistic and colorful look inspired by the animation style of YouTube channel Kurzgesagt. These were then beautifully made by our project leader Linda Norlén and media producer Desirée Strand. Featured are Agda and Nahom, our primary personas. As a group, we held a meeting to iterate on the designs together, mainly focusing on the colors and minute details. These illustrations were used to aid our users in understanding the material presented in the classes, and make learning both fun and energetic.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <FullImage \n      image={internetskolan_final1}\n      caption=\"Screenshots from the final MVP web experience.\"\n      />\n\n    <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h3>Result</h3>\n      <h4>Final iteration and MVP</h4>\n      <p>As we were developing, we re-worked the color palette to a more vibrant purple with a bright pink accent color. I was very involved in the final touches on both UX and UI, and developed a majority of the MVP together with Desirée. A wave shape was added on the top and bottom to give the website a more organic and warm feel. We also iterated on the location tracker at the bottom to make the site easier to navigate, and added a back to top-button. I simplified the headers of the lessons to make it more clean and the content more readable. Since we'd spent so much time working on our hi-fi wireframes and planning our code, it was a seamless process to convert our design to code and continuously iterate on individual elements in this way.</p>\n      <h4>Client response</h4>\n      <p>Internetskolan and our MVP was lauded by both our client, teachers and classmates alike. We got great feedback on the extent of our research and user testing (despite working 100% remotely), our approach to solving the problem at hand and attention to detail. Our client was extremely happy with the result, and wished to pursue it further by introducing it to their higher-ups. At the end of the project, our client even offered to act as references for us, and were very interested in having us come back to work with them in the future.</p>\n      <h4>The future of Internetskolan</h4>\n      <p>As we only had access to people outside the specific user group of elderly people living in Spånga-Tensta, performing rigorous user testing with the actual users in mind should be the top priority for any future development of Internetskolan. As we only had time to finish a very hi-fi prototype within the scope of the project, it would also be necessary to further develop lessons, the lexicon and link page.</p>\n      <h3>What I learned</h3>\n      <p>Through working on this project, I learned a lot more about working with different demographics, the usefulness and necessity of proper user research, and gained more confidence in my UI and web development abilities. Working solely on this project for a whole month was a true joy, and by the end I was so excited about it all I wanted was to keep working on it. Finally, I learned more about working with surveys, data gathering and user testing to create a bespoke, user centered design solution.</p>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <BackToTop />\n    \n    </div>\n\n  )\n}\n \nexport default InternetskolanContent;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sustainlab_head.41985d5f.gif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sustainlab_lofi.31efb0a7.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sustainlab_logo.f54aa864.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sustainlab_final.f61a73a7.jpg\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport FullImage from \"./CaseCmpnts.js\";\nimport sustainlab_head from \"./assets/sustainlab/sustainlab_head.gif\";\nimport sustainlab_lofi from \"./assets/sustainlab/sustainlab_lofi.jpg\";\nimport sustainlab_logo from \"./assets/sustainlab/sustainlab_logo.png\";\nimport sustainlab_final from './assets/sustainlab/sustainlab_final.jpg';\nimport BackToTop from \"./BackToTop.js\";\n\n\n \nfunction SustainlabContent(props) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"InnerCaseWrapper\">\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={sustainlab_head}\n      caption=\"The homepage of SustainLab-SH.\"\n      />\n      \n      <div className=\"visit-case-subject\">\n        <a href={'http://www.sustainlab-sh.se'}>Visit Sustainlab-SH here!</a>\n      </div>\n      \n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>The project</h3>\n        <p>SustainLab-SH is a venture by the Environmental Science Department of Södertörn University. In fall of 2020, they asked for students to create a website where they could share news, research and connect with other research departments and initiatives. I was chosen together with my partner David Wechana to create it. I was project manager, UI- and graphic designer, and David took responsibility over UX research and testing. We worked on the concept, wireframes and development of the website together.</p>\n        <h4>How we did it</h4>\n        <p>As David and I had limited time due to being in school, and it being my second semester of college, the department and I decided it would be best to create a sort of \"Phase 1\" website, that could be expanded on in the future as SustainLab-SH grew. As they wanted to be able to update the site themselves, share their research, as well publish posts, we decided to create the website in Wordpress and Elementor. The client also wanted us to produce a logo that would emulate both Södertörn University, fun and environmental research, which I got the task of producing.</p> \n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={sustainlab_lofi}\n      caption=\"Some of our lo-fi wireframes in Figma from early on in the project.\"\n      />\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={sustainlab_final}\n      caption=\"Some excerpts of the final website.\"\n      />\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={sustainlab_logo}\n      caption=\"The final logo variations and icon I created for SustainLab-SH.\"\n      />\n\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <p>David and I worked almost entirely remotely on this project, working primarily over Figma, Mural and Zoom.

We conducted iterative user testing throughout the project.</p>\n        <h3>Result</h3>\n        <p>Our client was very satisfied with the result, and our users enjoyed the design and usability of the site. The finished site features places for the department to share their research, news and partnerships. In the future, it will be easy to add functionality to the site as needed. At the end of the project, we handed off the website to a new group of students who would continue to work on- and administer the website.</p>\n      \n      </div>\n\n\n      <BackToTop />\n\n    </div>\n\n  )\n}\n \nexport default SustainlabContent;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/legimeet_vote.05092ecd.gif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/legimeet_example.25a6c7b1.jpg\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport FullImage from \"./CaseCmpnts.js\";\nimport legimeet_vote from \"./assets/legimeet/legimeet_vote.gif\";\nimport legimeet_example from \"./assets/legimeet/legimeet_example.jpg\";\nimport BackToTop from \"./BackToTop.js\";\n\n\n \nfunction LegimeetContent(props) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"InnerCaseWrapper\">\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={legimeet_vote}\n      caption=\"One of the voting modules as well as a more minimal menu UI I designed in the Legimeet demo.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"visit-case-subject\">\n        <a href={'https://www.legimeet.com/demo'}>See more of the demo here</a>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>About the project</h3>\n        <p>Legimeet is a startup company that offers digital Annual General Meetings (AGMs) as a service through the Twebcast platform. The platform offers a variety of interactive modules that can be used to create different projects, meetings and even conferences. These modules can be styled quite freely through HTML, CSS, and JS.</p> \n        <p>As Legimeet is a small startup, they needed a designer who could also develop using HTML and CSS, and so I was brought onboard to work on some of their AGMs as well as the modules used in their demo. Eventually, I also got to work on some graphic design for their social media, webinars and product listing.</p>\n        <h4>A fast paced startup</h4>\n        <p>As I was only at Legimeet one day a week as well as the only designer, the work pace was very fast, with designs often being commissioned, designed and implemented in a day. This lead to an agile approach where new designs were produced, evaluated by the team and then iterated upon. Since each AGM consisted of several different modules that each needed a unique design, both speed and iteration were key. For overarching visual themes, I used Figma, Adobe XD and Illustrator before diving into development. However, I oftentimes designed straight in the CSS in order to test several ideas quickly, due to the design constraints of the Twebcast modules not always being clear until after the fact. For example, every design had to look good in both a wide- and medium screen mode without using media queries.</p>\n        </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={legimeet_example}\n      caption=\"Some excerpts of the UI I designed for the Legimeet demo using CSS.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <p>Each AGM featured a bespoke UI design custom made to fit their visual identity. Some projects I got to work on were Taxi Stockholm, Gigger and Landshypotek. My work as mostly consisted of designing and styling the AGMs through CSS, as well as implementing new elements as needed through HTML. As the service was hosted through Twebcast, the limitations on what could be done design wise only depended on the hard coded structure of the modules themselves.</p>\n        <h3>The result</h3>\n        <p>I was praised highly for my speed in getting things done, producing as well as implementing consistent designs that fit the visual identities of the different clients, and my design ability overall. The designs were received very well by both our clients and Legimeet themselves. From my time at Legimeet, I learned a lot about working efficiently, thinking outside of the box and really improved my CSS skills.</p>\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n      <BackToTop />\n\n    </div>\n\n  )\n}\n \nexport default LegimeetContent;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/leo_box.5da9dc50.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/leo_karta.d0245beb.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/leo_reklam.4ed7b155.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/leo_process.6b4079fa.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/leo_logos.29c7103c.png\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport FullImage from \"./CaseCmpnts.js\";\nimport leo_box from \"./assets/leo/leo_box.png\";\nimport leo_karta from \"./assets/leo/leo_karta.png\";\nimport leo_reklam from \"./assets/leo/leo_reklam.jpg\";\nimport leo_process from \"./assets/leo/leo_process.jpg\";\nimport leo_logos from \"./assets/leo/leo_logos.png\";\nimport BackToTop from \"./BackToTop.js\";\n\n\n \nfunction LeoContent(props) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"InnerCaseWrapper\">\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={leo_reklam}\n      caption=\"The mock-up of an ad for Leo; I produced as part of the assignment.\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n        <h3>The project</h3>\n        <p>Leo; was one of my first works in graphic design, while I was still very new to the Adobe Suite and learning about the basics of design.

I always found it very funny how they were so happy about these products, being playful with friends, laughing with their arms stretched to the sky. That felt very far removed from the reality of using these products. For the name, I played around with different Greek words relating to love and sexuality, but settled on Leo as it felt both neutral, warm and kind.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <FullImage \n      image={leo_logos}\n      caption=\"Different inversions of the final logotype for Leo;\"\n      />\n\n      <div className=\"case-text\">\n      <h4>Designing Leo;</h4>\n      <p>For the main font, I chose to go with Cutive, a rounded slab serif, inspired by typography found on medical products and packaging.

The semi-colon was added to represent the continuation of something that could've ended; as in, you get to decide when to go, and when to stop. The dark turquoise was chosen to be attractive to a wide range of men, as well as give a sense of trust and comfort that blue tones usually imbibe.
